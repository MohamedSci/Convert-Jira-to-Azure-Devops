__Title:*
400 Status Code Error Occurs When Printing Cash Receipt Report Despite Successful Download
__Description:*
When a user selects the _From Date_ and _To Date_ in the _Cash Receipt Report_ screen and clicks the _Print_ button, a _400 Bad Request error_ appears in the network console. However, the report is still downloaded successfully. This error may indicate an _incorrect API request_ or _unnecessary validation issues_.
__Preconditions:*
* The user is logged into the ERP system.
_ The _Cash Receipt Report* module is accessible.
__Steps to Reproduce:*
- Navigate to _Finance Module > Reports > Cash Receipt Report_.
- Select a valid _From Date_ and _To Date_ in the date filters.
- Click the _Print_ button.
- Observe the network logs in the browser's developer console (_F12 > Network tab_).
__Expected Result:*
_ The _report should be printed/downloaded successfully_ without any _error messages*.
_ No _400 status code* should be logged in the network console.
_ If there is an issue with the request, a _clear validation or error message* should be displayed to the user.
__Actual Result:*
_ The report is _successfully downloaded*.
_ However, the network console logs a _400 Bad Request error*.
_ No _informational message* is shown to the user regarding the error.
__Suggested Fix:*
_ Investigate _why the request is returning a 400 error* even though the report is being downloaded.
_ Ensure that the _API request for printing_ is correctly formatted and _does not contain invalid parameters*.
_ If the request is expected to fail under certain conditions, show a _clear validation message* to the user instead of silently logging an error.
__Severity:*
? _Medium_ ? The report is still downloaded, but the error might indicate deeper API or validation issues that could cause failures in the future.

__Title:*
Cash Receipt Report Automatically Displays Data Upon Navigation Without Applying Any Filters
__Description:*
When navigating to the _Cash Receipt Report_ module, the report automatically displays and loads data _without requiring any user-selected filters_. This can lead to _incorrect or unintended data being displayed_, potentially exposing unnecessary financial information.
__Preconditions:*
* The user is logged into the ERP system.
_ The _Cash Receipt Report* module is accessible.
__Steps to Reproduce:*
- Navigate to _Finance Module > Reports > Cash Receipt Report_.
- Observe that the report _immediately loads and displays data_ without requiring any filter selection.
__Expected Result:*
_ The report should _not load or display any data_ unless the user selects the _required filters (e.g., date range, payment method, account, etc.)*.
_ Instead, an _informational message_ should appear, prompting the user to _apply filters before displaying data*.
__Actual Result:*
_ The report _automatically displays data_ upon navigation _without any user input*.
_ This behavior may lead to _unintended data visibility issues_ and can _impact performance* due to unnecessary data loading.
__Suggested Fix:*
* Prevent the report from automatically displaying data upon navigation.
_ Implement a _filter requirement_, ensuring that users _must select at least one filter* before retrieving report data.
_ Display an _informational message*: _""Please select filters before generating the report.""_
__Severity:*
? _Medium_ ? Could lead to unnecessary data exposure and performance inefficiencies.

__Title:*
Cash Payment Report Uses a Single Date Input for ""From"" and ""To"" Dates, Causing Inconsistencies and Validation Issues
__Description:*
The _Cash Payment Report_ screen allows users to filter reports using a _date range_; however, it only provides a _single date input field with one calendar_ to select both the _""From"" and ""To"" dates_. This implementation leads to _inconsistencies_ in user input and causes the system to display _unwanted required validation messages_, making it difficult to generate reports correctly.

Validation Message Incorrectly Displays After Selecting a Date from the Calendar in [Cash Payment Report|https://ibrahimmohamed.microtecdev.com:2050/finance/reports/cash-payment-report]
__Description:*
When the user selects a _day_ from the _calendar widget_ and clicks once, the selected date is correctly _inputted in the label_, but the system _still displays a required validation message_ incorrectly. However, when the user _clicks the same date twice_, the validation message does _not_ appear unnecessarily. This behavior causes _user confusion_ as the field appears valid but is still flagged as required.
__Preconditions:*
* The user is logged into the ERP system.
_ A date input field with a _calendar widget* is available.
__Steps to Reproduce:*
- Navigate to thein [Cash Payment Report|https://ibrahimmohamed.microtecdev.com:2050/finance/reports/cash-payment-report]
- Click the calendar  _date input field_ to open the _date picker_.
- Select _any day_ and click it _once_.
- Observe that the _date is displayed in the field_, but a required validation message appears.
- Click the same date _twice_.
- Observe that the validation message disappears.
__Expected Result:*
_ _After a single click_, the system should recognize the selected date and _not display the required validation message*.
_ The validation message should _only_ appear if the user attempts to submit the form _without selecting a date*.
__Actual Result:*
_ After _one click_, the date is set correctly, but the required validation message _is incorrectly displayed*.
_ After _two clicks_, the validation message _disappears*, even though the selection was already valid after the first click.
__Suggested Fix:*
_ Ensure the _validation check_ properly detects that a date is selected _after one click*.
_ Remove any _unnecessary validation triggers* when the user selects a date.
_ Test the date picker behavior to ensure _consistent input handling*.
__Severity:*
? _Medium_ ? Causes _user confusion_ but does not block form submission.

__Title:*
Payment Out Print Action Fails ? API Returns 404 Not Found
__Description:*
When users attempt to print a _Payment Out_ transaction from the _Payment Out List View_, the system does not respond, and no action is performed. Upon investigation in the browser _Developer Tools (Network Tab)_, the API request for printing returns a _404 Not Found_ error, indicating a broken API endpoint or incorrect URL mapping.
__Preconditions:*
* The user is logged into the ERP system with the necessary permissions.
_ There are existing _Payment Out* transactions in the list view.
__Steps to Reproduce:*
- Navigate to _Finance Module ? Transactions ? Payment Out List View_.
- Select an existing _Payment Out_ transaction.
- Click the _Print_ action button.
- Observe that _no print preview or action is triggered_.
- Open the _Developer Tools (F12) ? Network Tab_ and review the print API request.
- Notice that the request _returns a 404 Not Found_ error.
__Expected Result:*
_ The system should successfully generate a _print preview_ for the selected _Payment Out* transaction.
* The API request should return a valid response with the formatted print data.
_ If the API endpoint is missing or incorrect, the system should display a _meaningful error message* instead of failing silently.
__Actual Result:*
_ Clicking the _Print* button does nothing.
_ The API request fails with a _404 Not Found* error.
* No feedback or error message is displayed to the user.
__Suggested Fix:*
_ _Verify and correct* the API endpoint used for printing Payment Out transactions.
_ Ensure that the _correct URL* is mapped in the backend API.
_ Implement _error handling* to inform the user when the print action fails.
* Add logging to capture and report failed API requests for debugging purposes.
__Severity:*
?? _Critical_ ? This issue prevents users from printing Payment Out transactions, which may impact financial operations and reporting.

__Description:*
On the _Payment Reconciliation Report_ screen, when the user clicks the _Print_ button without applying any filters or selecting a customer, the system _generates an empty print preview_ instead of displaying a proper validation message. This can mislead users into thinking there is an issue with the report.
__Preconditions:*
_ The user is logged into the ERP system with access to the _Payment Reconciliation Report* module.
__Steps to Reproduce:*
- Navigate to _Finance Module ? Reports ? Payment Reconciliation Report_.
- Do _not_ apply any filters or select a customer.
- Click the _Print_ button.
- Observe that an _empty print preview_ is generated with no data.
__Expected Result:*

_ The Print button should be _disabled* until valid data is available for printing.

Bug,(SP24): Payment Reconciliation Report Does Not Display Reconciled Invoices for Selected Customer,Mohamed Fathy,Mohamed Said,4,To Do,2025-03-02T15:51:00.000Z,2025-03-03T14:21:00.000Z,"### Description
__Payment Reconciliation Report Does Not Display Reconciled Invoices for Selected Customer*
__Title:*
Payment Reconciliation Report Fails to Display Reconciled Invoices and Shows Incorrect Invoice List
__Description:*
On the _Payment Reconciliation Report_ screen, when a user selects a customer, the report _does not display_ the invoices that have been _successfully reconciled_. Instead, the _Select Invoice_ dropdown incorrectly shows _only non-reconciled invoices_, preventing users from accessing reconciliation details. This issue affects financial reporting accuracy and reconciliation tracking.
__Preconditions:*
_ The user is logged into the ERP system with access to the _Payment Reconciliation Report* module.
* At least one invoice has been successfully reconciled for the selected customer.
__Steps to Reproduce:*
- Navigate to _Finance Module ? Reports ? Payment Reconciliation Report_.
- Select a _customer_ who has reconciled invoices.
- Open the _Select Invoice_ dropdown.
- Observe that the dropdown _only lists non-reconciled invoices_ instead of displaying reconciled ones.
- Attempt to generate a reconciliation report and notice that _no data appears_ for reconciled invoices.
__Expected Result:*
_ The _Select Invoice_ dropdown should display _both fully and partially reconciled invoices* for the selected customer.
_ The report should correctly show _reconciliation details_, including _invoice status, reconciled amount, and remaining balance*.
__Actual Result:*
_ The dropdown incorrectly lists only _non-reconciled invoices*, preventing users from selecting reconciled invoices.
_ The report does not show _any data* for reconciled invoices.
__Suggested Fix:*
_ Modify the query logic to _include reconciled invoices_ in the _Select Invoice* dropdown.
_ Ensure that the _report correctly fetches and displays* reconciliation details.
_ Validate that the system retrieves _both fully and partially reconciled invoices* for the selected customer.
__Severity:*
?? _High_ ? This issue impacts financial reporting and reconciliation tracking, leading to incorrect financial records.

Bug,(Sp24): Amount Field in Add Payment In Screen Accepts Negative Numbers Without Validation,mohamed Nabil,Mohamed Said,4,Code review,2025-03-02T13:15:00.000Z,2025-03-05T12:41:00.000Z,"### Description
__Title:*
Negative Amounts Can Be Entered and Saved in Payment In Screen Without Validation
__Description:*
On the _Add Payment In_ screen, the _Amount_ field in the _Detail Section_ allows users to enter negative values. The system successfully _saves and posts_ the transaction without any validation or error message. This issue leads to severe inconsistencies in _financial calculations, reconciliation, and related module transactions_, affecting overall system accuracy.
__Preconditions:*
_ The user is logged into the ERP system with permission to create and post _Payment In* transactions.
__Steps to Reproduce:*
- Navigate to _Finance Module ? Transactions ? Add Payment In_ screen.
- In the _Detail Section_, enter a _negative amount_ (e.g., {{-1000}}).
- Click _Save_, then _Post_ the transaction.
- Observe that the system allows the transaction to be saved and posted without validation.
- Check the related financial reports, reconciliation, and transaction history to see discrepancies.
__Expected Result:*
_ The system should _not allow_ negative values in the _Amount* field.
_ If a negative value is entered, an _error message* should be displayed, preventing the user from saving or posting the transaction.
* Proper validation should be enforced to ensure only positive values are accepted.
__Actual Result:*
_ The system allows negative amounts in the _Amount* field.
* The transaction is successfully saved and posted without any validation.
_ This leads to financial calculation errors in _balancing, reconciliation, and other dependent modules*.
__Suggested Fix:*
_ Implement _validation_ to restrict negative values in the _Amount* field.
_ Display a clear _error message* when a negative value is entered.
* Prevent transactions with negative amounts from being saved or posted.
_ Conduct a _system-wide audit* to check if similar validation issues exist in other financial modules.
__Severity:*
?? _Critical_ ? This issue impacts financial accuracy, reconciliation, and balance calculations, leading to serious financial discrepancies.

__Title:*
Search Functionality Fails in the Advanced Search Dialog for Selecting an Account Across Multiple ERP Modules
__Description:*
In multiple modules of the ERP system, including _Treasury Definition, Bank Definition, Payment In, and Payment Out_, the _Advanced Search (Select Account)_ dialog does not filter results when the user enters a search term. This issue prevents users from efficiently finding and selecting an account, leading to delays and poor user experience.
__Affected Modules:*
* Treasury Definition Add/Edit
* Bank Definition Add/Edit
* Payment In Add/Edit
* Payment Out Add/Edit
__Preconditions:*
* The user is logged into the ERP system with appropriate access to the affected modules.
* The system contains existing accounts available for selection.
__Steps to Reproduce:*
- Navigate to any of the affected modules (e.g., _Treasury Definition Add/Edit_).
- Click on the _Select Account_ field to open the _Advanced Search Dialog_.
- In the search input field, type an account name or account code.
- Observe that no filtering or search results appear based on the entered query.
__Expected Result:*
* As the user types in the search field, the system should dynamically filter and display relevant account results.
_ The search should support filtering based on _account name_ or _account code*.
_ If no results match the search term, an appropriate _""No results found""* message should be displayed.
__Actual Result:*
* The search input does not trigger any filtering of the account list.
* The full list of accounts remains unchanged, even when entering a search term.
* Users are unable to efficiently locate specific accounts, leading to a poor user experience.
__Suggested Fix:*
* Ensure that the search input field triggers a request to filter the accounts dynamically.
_ Validate whether _API requests* for search functionality are being made correctly.
_ Implement _debouncing* to prevent excessive search requests.
_ Ensure that the search function considers both _account name_ and _account code*.
* Display an appropriate message when no matching results are found.
__Severity:*
_High_ ? The inability to search for accounts across multiple modules significantly impacts user workflow and system efficiency.

* The system has existing accounts available for selection.
__Steps to Reproduce:*
- Navigate to _Treasury Module ? Treasury Definition Add/Edit_ screen.
- Click on the Advanced Search Icon of the _Select Account_ field to open the _Advanced Search Dialog_.
- In the search input field, type an account name or account code.
- Observe that no filtering or search results appear based on the entered query.
__Expected Result:*
* As the user types in the search field, the system should dynamically filter and display relevant account results.
_ The search should support filtering based on _account name_ or _account code*.
_ If no results match the search term, an appropriate _""No results found""* message should be displayed.
__Actual Result:*
* The search input does not trigger any filtering of the account list.
* The full list of accounts remains unchanged, even when entering a search term.
* Users are unable to efficiently locate specific accounts, leading to a poor user experience.
__Suggested Fix:*
* Ensure that the search input field triggers a request to filter the accounts dynamically.
_ Validate whether _API requests* for search functionality are being made correctly.
_ Implement _debouncing* to prevent excessive search requests.
_ Ensure that the search function considers both _account name_ and _account code*.
* Display an appropriate message when no matching results are found.
__Severity:*
_High_ ? Users are unable to efficiently select an account, which directly impacts their ability to complete Treasury Definitions.

Bug,(SP24): Non-descriptive error message displayed in a pop-up when selecting a Bank account with an invalid payment method.,Hager Mostafa,Mohamed Said,2,Code review,2025-02-27T15:59:00.000Z,2025-03-02T14:12:00.000Z,"### Description
__Title:*
Non-descriptive error message displayed in a pop-up when selecting a Bank account with an invalid payment method.
----
__Description:*
When a user selects a _Bank account_ that has a payment method other than _Transfer_ (e.g., Visa or Span) in the _Fund Transfer Add_ screen, a non-descriptive error message is displayed in a pop-up at the bottom layer. The message reads:
_""Error you can't select bank without payment method.""_
This message is not informative, does not guide the user to resolve the issue, and appears in an incorrect view (pop-up at the bottom layer). According to the business rules, only Bank accounts with the _Transfer_ payment method should be selectable for Fund Transfers.
----
__Precondition:*
- The user is logged in with the necessary permissions.
- The _Fund Transfer Add_ screen is accessible.
- At least one Bank account exists in the system with a payment method other than _Transfer_ (e.g., Visa or Span).
----
__Steps to Reproduce:*
- Navigate to _Finance Module > Transaction Submenu > Fund Transfer_.
- Click on the _Add_ button to open the Fund Transfer Add screen.
- In the _Send From_ section:
-_ Select _Bank_ in the _Payment Hub* field.
-_ In the _Payment Hub Details_ field, select a Bank account that has a payment method other than _Transfer* (e.g., Visa or Span).
- Observe the system behavior.
----
__Expected Result:*
_ The system should display a _clear and informative error message_ in the correct view (e.g., near the _Payment Hub Details* field or in a modal dialog).
_ The error message should guide the user to select a Bank account with the _Transfer* payment method.
* Example of an informative message:
_""Invalid Payment Method: Please select a Bank account with the 'Transfer' payment method.""_
----
__Actual Result:*
* A non-descriptive error message is displayed in a pop-up at the bottom layer:
_""Error you can't select bank without payment method.""_
* The message does not specify the issue or guide the user to resolve it.
* The pop-up appears in an incorrect view (bottom layer), making it less noticeable.
----
__Impact:*
* Users are confused by the non-descriptive error message and may not understand how to resolve the issue.
* The incorrect placement of the pop-up (bottom layer) makes it easy to miss, leading to frustration and delays in completing the transaction.
* This issue affects the user experience and may result in incorrect data entry or abandoned transactions.
----
__Severity:*
_Medium_ ? This is a usability issue that impacts the user experience but does not prevent the core functionality from working.
----
__Priority:*
_High_ ? The error message needs to be improved to ensure users can complete their tasks efficiently.
----
__Attachments:*
- Screenshot of the non-descriptive error message in the pop-up.
- Screenshot of the Fund Transfer Add screen with the selected Bank account.
- Logs or additional error details from the system.
----
__Root Cause Analysis (If Available):*
The issue occurs because:
- The system allows the selection of Bank accounts with payment methods other than _Transfer_, even though the business rules specify that only _Transfer_ is acceptable.
- The error message is hardcoded and does not provide sufficient context or guidance.
- The pop-up is displayed in an incorrect view (bottom layer), making it less noticeable and user-friendly.
----
__Suggested Fix:*
- _Validation Rule:_
-_ Update the system to filter and display only Bank accounts with the _Transfer_ payment method in the _Payment Hub Details* dropdown.
-* If a Bank account with an invalid payment method is selected, prevent the selection and display an informative error message in the correct view.
- _Error Message:_
-* Replace the non-descriptive message with a clear and informative one, such as:
-_""Invalid Payment Method: Please select a Bank account with the 'Transfer' payment method.""_
- _UI/UX Improvement:_
-_ Display the error message near the _Payment Hub Details* field or in a modal dialog for better visibility.
-* Ensure the message is displayed in a user-friendly format (e.g., red text with an icon).

__Priority:*
_Urgent_ ? This issue needs immediate attention as it affects core functionality.
----
__Attachments:*
- Screenshot of the error message in the network log.
- Screenshot of the Fund Transfer Add screen with the entered data.
- Logs or additional error details from the server.
----
__Root Cause Analysis (If Available):*
The error message suggests that the issue occurs while saving the entity changes. The inner exception (not visible in the logs) may provide more details about the specific cause. Possible causes include:
* A mismatch between the payment methods (Transfer and Cash) during the transaction processing.
* A database constraint or validation rule that is not being handled correctly.
* An issue with the entity mapping or data persistence logic.
----
__Suggested Fix:*
- Investigate the inner exception details to identify the exact cause of the error.
- Ensure that the system handles the combination of _Transfer_ (Bank) and _Cash_ (Treasury) payment methods correctly.
- Validate the entity mapping and database constraints to ensure they align with the business rules.
- Add proper error handling and user-friendly messages to guide users in case of similar issues.
----
__Additional Notes:*
* This issue should be tested in the development environment before deploying to production.
* Regression testing should be performed to ensure that other Fund Transfer scenarios (e.g., Bank to Bank, Treasury to Treasury) are not affected.

__Title:*
Save Button Successfully Saves Reconciliation but Does Not Redirect or Reset the Screen
__Description:*
On the _Payment Reconciliation_ screen in the _Finance App_, after clicking the _Save_ button, the reconciliation is successfully saved, and a _success popup_ is displayed. However, the screen remains stuck, and all manipulated fields still retain the same data and state instead of refreshing or redirecting. This creates confusion for users as they are unsure whether the reconciliation has been processed correctly.
__Preconditions:*
_ The user is logged into the ERP system with access to the _Finance App*.
_ The user has navigated to _Finance Module ? Transactions ? Payment Reconciliation*.
* A customer and a payment have been selected.
* One or more invoices have been selected for reconciliation.
__Steps to Reproduce:*
- Navigate to _Finance Module ? Transactions ? Payment Reconciliation_.
- Select a customer from the _Customer Selection_ popup.
- Select a payment from the _Payment Selection_ popup.
- Choose one or more invoices for reconciliation.
- Click the _Reconcile_ button to apply the payment.
- Click the _Save_ button.
- Observe that the reconciliation is successfully saved, and a _success popup_ appears.
- Notice that the screen does not refresh or redirect, and the fields still show the same data.
__Expected Result:*
* After successful reconciliation, the screen should either:
__ Redirect the user to the _Payment Reconciliation List_ screen.
__ Refresh and reset the fields to their default state.
* The previously reconciled invoices should no longer appear as pending reconciliation.
_ The UI should provide a _clear indication* that the process has been completed.
__Actual Result:*
_ The _Save* button successfully saves the reconciliation and displays a success popup.
* The screen remains unchanged with all manipulated fields retaining the same data.
* Users are unsure whether the reconciliation was actually processed.
__Suggested Fix:*
_ Implement a _screen refresh or redirection* after successful reconciliation.
_ Automatically _reset all fields* and update the invoice list to reflect the reconciliation.
_ Ensure that reconciled invoices are _removed from the pending list*.
* Provide a clear confirmation message indicating that the process is complete and that no further action is required.
__Severity:*
_Medium-High_ ? The issue does not prevent reconciliation but causes confusion and inefficiency for users.

Bug,(SP21) @General: Search Functionality Sends Excessive Requests Due to Lack of Debouncing ,Abanoub.Nabil,Mohamed Said,3,To Do,2025-02-23T11:29:00.000Z,2025-02-23T12:21:00.000Z,"### Description
_Title:_
Search Functionality Sends Excessive Requests Due to Lack of Debouncing
----
_Description:_
The search functionality does not efficiently handle user input, causing an excessive number of requests to be sent to the server. Each time the user types a character, a request is immediately triggered, even if the time between keystrokes is less than one second. This can lead to server overload, performance issues, and unnecessary network traffic. Implementing _debouncing_ should optimize the search behavior.
----
_Precondition:_
* The ERP system is accessible, and the user has access to the search feature.
----
_Steps to Reproduce:_
- Log in to the ERP system.
- Navigate to a screen where the search functionality is available.
- Start typing a search term letter by letter.
- Observe that each keystroke triggers a request without waiting for a pause in typing.
----
_Expected Result:_
_ The search functionality should implement _debouncing*, meaning it waits for a short delay (e.g., 500?800ms) after the user stops typing before sending a request.
* This reduces unnecessary server requests and improves performance.
----
_Actual Result:_
* A request is sent for every character typed, even if the delay between keystrokes is very short.
* This causes excessive API calls, leading to increased server load and potential performance degradation.
----
_Suggested Fix:_
_ Implement _Debouncing* in the search functionality to delay API requests until the user has stopped typing for a defined period (e.g., 500?800ms).

Bug,(Sp21): Unable to Save Return Purchase Invoice Due to Unposted Transaction,Abanoub.Nabil,Mohamed Said,3,To Do,2025-02-17T15:52:00.000Z,2025-03-03T15:03:00.000Z,"### Description
__Title: Unable to Save Return Purchase Invoice Due to Unposted Transaction*
__Issue Description:*
When the user attempts to _return items_ using the _""Return Purchase Invoice"" Add_ screen and saves the transaction without posting it, they are unable to create another return transaction for the same invoice.
On the second attempt to return items from the same invoice, clicking the _Save_ button _does nothing_, and the _network log_ shows an error with _Status Code 500_.
__Steps to Reproduce:*
- Navigate to _Return Purchase Invoice Add_ screen.
- Select a _Purchase Invoice_ to return items from.
- Fill in all _required data_ and return _each item's available quantity_.
- Click _Save_ (but do not post the transaction).
- Open the _Return Purchase Invoice Add_ screen again and select the _same invoice_.
- Fill in all _required data_ and attempt to _return the items again_.
- Click _Save_ and observe that _nothing happens_.
- Check the _network log_, which shows _HTTP 500 Internal Server Error_.
__Expected Behavior:*
_ The system should _display an informative message_ if there is an _unposted* return transaction related to the same Purchase Invoice.
_ The message should guide the user to either _post_ or _cancel* the pending return before proceeding with a new one.
_ The system should _not fail silently*, and it should prevent the user from facing an unexpected error.
__Actual Behavior:*
_ When the user attempts to save a second _Return Purchase Invoice* for the same invoice:
__ Clicking the _Save_ button does _nothing_.
__ The _network log_ shows an _HTTP 500 Internal Server Error_.
__ No error message is displayed to the user, leaving them confused.
h4. 
__Impact:*
_ Prevents users from _processing valid returns*.
_ Causes _confusion* due to the lack of an error message.
_ Results in _system instability* (HTTP 500 errors).
_ Affects the _accuracy of purchase return records*.
__Severity:_ _High*
This issue blocks users from completing return transactions, affecting inventory accuracy and financial records.
__Suggested Fix:*
_ Implement _validation logic_ to check if an _unposted return transaction_ exists for the selected _Purchase Invoice*.
_ Display a _clear error message* before saving, such as:
_""There is an unposted return transaction related to this Purchase Invoice. Please post or cancel it before creating a new one.""_
_ Ensure that the system _does not trigger a 500 error* and handles this scenario gracefully.

__Bug Report: Help Button Navigation Issues*
__Issue Description:*
When the user clicks the _Help_ button on any screen, the system navigates to the Help Pages. However, the following issues occur:
- _No Return to Previous Screen:_ There is no option to return back to the previous screen from the Help Pages.
- _Incorrect Back Navigation Behavior:_ If the user manually navigates back, it returns to the parent-related Help Pages instead of the previous screen.
- _Side Menu Displays Incorrect Options:_ The side menu incorrectly displays _General Settings_ module options instead of maintaining the context of the previously accessed screen.
__Steps to Reproduce:*
- Navigate to any module or transaction screen (e.g., Sales Invoice, Purchase Order, etc.).
- Click on the _Help_ button.
- Observe that the system navigates to the _Help Pages_ instead of opening in a new tab.
- Attempt to navigate back using the browser back button.
- Notice that it does not return to the previous screen but instead loads parent-related help pages.
- Observe the side menu displaying _General Settings_ instead of the relevant module options.
__Expected Behavior:*
_ The Help Page should open in a _new window_ or _new tab* instead of redirecting the user from the current screen.
_ If the Help Page is opened in the same window, a _clear return option* should be provided to navigate back to the previously accessed screen.
* The side menu should remain consistent with the user's previously selected module / App, not default to General Settings.
__Actual Behavior:*
* The system redirects the user away from their current work screen when they click the Help button.
* There is no direct way to return to the screen where the user clicked the Help button.
_ The side menu shows _General Settings* options instead of the appropriate module.
__Impact:*
* Interrupts user workflow as they lose their place in the system.
* Causes confusion due to incorrect navigation and missing return functionality.
* Leads to inefficiency since users have to manually navigate back to the intended module.
__Severity:_ _Medium to High*
This issue affects usability and navigation across all modules, causing disruptions in user experience.
__Suggested Fix:*
_ Modify the Help Button functionality to _open the Help Pages in a new tab or window* instead of navigating away.
_ Ensure that if the Help Page opens in the same window, there is a _Return to Previous Page* button.
* Maintain the side menu context based on the user's current module instead of defaulting to General Settings.
