Cash Payment Report Uses a Single Date Input for ""From"" and ""To"" Dates  Causing Inconsistencies and Validation Issues
__Description:*
The _Cash Payment Report_ screen allows users to filter reports using a _date range_; however  it only provides a _single date input field with one calendar_ to select both the _""From"" and ""To"" dates_. This implementation leads to _inconsistencies_ in user input and causes the system to display _unwanted required validation messages_  making it difficult to generate reports correctly.
__Preconditions:*
* The user is logged into the ERP system.
_ The _Cash Payment Report* screen is accessible.
__Steps to Reproduce:*
- Navigate to _Finance App > Reports > Cash Payment Report_.
- Locate the _date input field_ for selecting the date range.
- Click the _calendar icon_ and select a date.
- Observe that the same _single date input field is used_ for both _""From"" and ""To""_ dates.
- Try to generate the report  and observe the _validation messages_.
__Expected Result:*
_ The report should have _two separate date input fields*:
__ _""From Date""_: Start of the date range.
__ _""To Date""_: End of the date range.
_ Users should be able to _select the date range correctly* without confusion.
_ The system should _not display unnecessary validation errors*.
__Actual Result:*
_ A _single date input field* is used for both ""From"" and ""To"" dates.
_ The system displays _inconsistent required validation messages*.
_ Users _cannot properly define a date range_  leading to _incorrect report filtering*.
__Suggested Fix:*
_ Replace the _single date input field_ with _two separate date pickers* for ""From"" and ""To"" dates.
* Ensure the validation logic correctly checks whether both dates are selected.
_ Prevent _invalid date ranges* (e.g.  ""To Date"" should not be earlier than ""From Date"").
__Severity:*
? _High_ ? Affects usability and accuracy of financial reports."

_ The validation message should _only_ appear if the user attempts to submit the form _without selecting a date*.
__Actual Result:*
_ After _one click_  the date is set correctly  but the required validation message _is incorrectly displayed*.
_ After _two clicks_  the validation message _disappears*  even though the selection was already valid after the first click.
__Suggested Fix:*
_ Ensure the _validation check_ properly detects that a date is selected _after one click*.
_ Remove any _unnecessary validation triggers* when the user selects a date.
_ Test the date picker behavior to ensure _consistent input handling*.

- click _Print_ Button
- Observe that the report screen is _empty_ with no data.

- The action buttons should be displayed in a logical and consistent order (e.g.  View  Edit  Delete  Print).
- Tooltips should appear when hovering over each action button  describing their functionality (e.g.  ""View "" ""Edit "" ""Delete "" ""Print"").
----
__Actual Result:*
- The _Print_ button has the same icon as the _View_ button  causing confusion.
- The order of the action buttons is incorrect or inconsistent.
- No tooltips are displayed when hovering over the action buttons.
----
__Impact:*
* Users may accidentally click the wrong button due to the incorrect icon and lack of tooltips.
* The inconsistent button order and missing tooltips reduce the usability and user experience of the Fund Transfer List View.
* This issue may lead to user frustration and errors in navigating the system.
----

Bug,(SP24): Non-descriptive error message displayed in a pop-up when selecting a Bank account with an invalid payment method,Hagar Mostafa,Muhammed Saeed,2,New,2025-02-27T17:59:00Z,2025-02-27T17:59:00Z,"__Title:*
Non-descriptive error message displayed in a pop-up when selecting a Bank account with an invalid payment method.
----
__Description:*
When a user selects a _Bank account_ that has a payment method other than _Transfer_ (e.g.  Visa or Span) in the _Fund Transfer Add_ screen  a non-descriptive error message is displayed in a pop-up at the bottom layer. The message reads:
_""Error you can't select bank without payment method.""_
This message is not informative  does not guide the user to resolve the issue  and appears in an incorrect view (pop-up at the bottom layer). According to the business rules  only Bank accounts with the _Transfer_ payment method should be selectable for Fund Transfers.
----
__Precondition:*
- The user is logged in with the necessary permissions.
- The _Fund Transfer Add_ screen is accessible.
- At least one Bank account exists in the system with a payment method other than _Transfer_ (e.g.  Visa or Span).
----
__Steps to Reproduce:*
- Navigate to _Finance Module > Transaction Submenu > Fund Transfer_.
- Click on the _Add_ button to open the Fund Transfer Add screen.
- In the _Send From_ section:
-_ Select _Bank_ in the _Payment Hub* field.
-_ In the _Payment Hub Details_ field  select a Bank account that has a payment method other than _Transfer* (e.g.  Visa or Span).
- Observe the system behavior.
----
__Expected Result:*
_ The system should display a _clear and informative error message_ in the correct view (e.g.  near the _Payment Hub Details* field or in a modal dialog).
_ The error message should guide the user to select a Bank account with the _Transfer* payment method.
* Example of an informative message:
_""Invalid Payment Method: Please select a Bank account with the 'Transfer' payment method.""_
----
__Actual Result:*
* A non-descriptive error message is displayed in a pop-up at the bottom layer:
_""Error you can't select bank without payment method.""_
* The message does not specify the issue or guide the user to resolve it.
* The pop-up appears in an incorrect view (bottom layer)  making it less noticeable.
----
__Impact:*
* Users are confused by the non-descriptive error message and may not understand how to resolve the issue.
* The incorrect placement of the pop-up (bottom layer) makes it easy to miss  leading to frustration and delays in completing the transaction.
* This issue affects the user experience and may result in incorrect data entry or abandoned transactions.
----
__Severity:*
_Medium_ ? This is a usability issue that impacts the user experience but does not prevent the core functionality from working.
----
__Priority:*
_High_ ? The error message needs to be improved to ensure users can complete their tasks efficiently.
----
__Attachments:*
- Screenshot of the non-descriptive error message in the pop-up.
- Screenshot of the Fund Transfer Add screen with the selected Bank account.
- Logs or additional error details from the system.
----
__Root Cause Analysis (If Available):*
The issue occurs because:
- The system allows the selection of Bank accounts with payment methods other than _Transfer_  even though the business rules specify that only _Transfer_ is acceptable.
- The error message is hardcoded and does not provide sufficient context or guidance.
- The pop-up is displayed in an incorrect view (bottom layer)  making it less noticeable and user-friendly.
----
__Suggested Fix:*
- _Validation Rule:_
-_ Update the system to filter and display only Bank accounts with the _Transfer_ payment method in the _Payment Hub Details* dropdown.
-* If a Bank account with an invalid payment method is selected  prevent the selection and display an informative error message in the correct view.
- _Error Message:_
-* Replace the non-descriptive message with a clear and informative one  such as:
-_""Invalid Payment Method: Please select a Bank account with the 'Transfer' payment method.""_
- _UI/UX Improvement:_
-_ Display the error message near the _Payment Hub Details* field or in a modal dialog for better visibility.
-* Ensure the message is displayed in a user-friendly format (e.g.  red text with an icon)."

Save Button Successfully Saves Reconciliation but Does Not Redirect or Reset the Screen
__Description:*
On the _Payment Reconciliation_ screen in the _Finance App_  after clicking the _Save_ button  the reconciliation is successfully saved  and a _success popup_ is displayed. However  the screen remains stuck  and all manipulated fields still retain the same data and state instead of refreshing or redirecting. This creates confusion for users as they are unsure whether the reconciliation has been processed correctly.
__Preconditions:*
_ The user is logged into the ERP system with access to the _Finance App*.
_ The user has navigated to _Finance Module ? Transactions ? Payment Reconciliation*.
* A customer and a payment have been selected.
* One or more invoices have been selected for reconciliation.

- Select a customer from the _Customer Selection_ popup.
- Select a payment from the _Payment Selection_ popup.
- Choose one or more invoices for reconciliation.
- Click the _Reconcile_ button to apply the payment.
- Click the _Save_ button.
- Observe that the reconciliation is successfully saved  and a _success popup_ appears.
- Notice that the screen does not refresh or redirect  and the fields still show the same data.
__Expected Result:*
* After successful reconciliation  the screen should either:
__ Redirect the user to the _Payment Reconciliation List_ screen.
__ Refresh and reset the fields to their default state.
* The previously reconciled invoices should no longer appear as pending reconciliation.
_ The UI should provide a _clear indication* that the process has been completed.
__Actual Result:*
_ The _Save* button successfully saves the reconciliation and displays a success popup.
* The screen remains unchanged with all manipulated fields retaining the same data.
* Users are unsure whether the reconciliation was actually processed.
__Suggested Fix:*
_ Implement a _screen refresh or redirection* after successful reconciliation.
_ Automatically _reset all fields* and update the invoice list to reflect the reconciliation.
_ Ensure that reconciled invoices are _removed from the pending list*.
* Provide a clear confirmation message indicating that the process is complete and that no further action is required.

__Expected Result:*
_ The _Cancel* button should successfully revert any unsaved reconciliation actions.
_ The _invoice list_ and _payment allocation* should return to their previous state.
_ A _confirmation prompt* should appear (if applicable)  asking the user to confirm cancellation.
__Actual Result:*
_ The _Cancel* button is not actionable (clicking it does not trigger any response).
* Unsaved reconciliation changes remain on the screen.
_ Users are forced to _reload the page manually* to undo changes.
__Suggested Fix:*
_ Ensure the _Cancel* button is correctly bound to a function that reverts changes.
_ Implement a _confirmation popup* to confirm the cancellation of actions.
* Ensure that unsaved changes are discarded  and the original state is restored.

Bug,(SP21) @General: Search Functionality Sends Excessive Requests Due to Lack of Debouncing ,Abanoub Nabil,Muhammed Saeed,2,New,2025-02-23T13:29:00Z,2025-02-23T13:29:00Z,"_Title:_
Search Functionality Sends Excessive Requests Due to Lack of Debouncing
----
_Description:_
The search functionality does not efficiently handle user input  causing an excessive number of requests to be sent to the server. Each time the user types a character  a request is immediately triggered  even if the time between keystrokes is less than one second. This can lead to server overload  performance issues  and unnecessary network traffic. Implementing _debouncing_ should optimize the search behavior.
----
_Precondition:_
* The ERP system is accessible  and the user has access to the search feature.
----
_Steps to Reproduce:_
- Log in to the ERP system.
- Navigate to a screen where the search functionality is available.
- Start typing a search term letter by letter.
- Observe that each keystroke triggers a request without waiting for a pause in typing.
----
_Expected Result:_
_ The search functionality should implement _debouncing*  meaning it waits for a short delay (e.g.  500?800ms) after the user stops typing before sending a request.
* This reduces unnecessary server requests and improves performance.
----
_Actual Result:_
* A request is sent for every character typed  even if the delay between keystrokes is very short.
* This causes excessive API calls  leading to increased server load and potential performance degradation.
----
_Suggested Fix:_
_ Implement _Debouncing* in the search functionality to delay API requests until the user has stopped typing for a defined period (e.g.  500?800ms)."
