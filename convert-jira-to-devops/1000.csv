400 Status Code Error Occurs When Printing Cash Receipt Report Despite Successful Download

h4. *Description:*

When a user selects the *From Date* and *To Date* in the *Cash Receipt Report* screen and clicks the *Print* button  a *400 Bad Request error* appears in the network console. However  the report is still downloaded successfully. This error may indicate an *incorrect API request* or *unnecessary validation issues*.

h4. *Preconditions:*

* The user is logged into the ERP system.
* The *Cash Receipt Report* module is accessible.

h4. *Steps to Reproduce:*

# Navigate to *Finance Module > Reports > Cash Receipt Report*.
# Select a valid *From Date* and *To Date* in the date filters.
# Click the *Print* button.
# Observe the network logs in the browser's developer console (*F12 > Network tab*).

h4. *Expected Result:*

* The *report should be printed/downloaded successfully* without any *error messages*.
* No *400 status code* should be logged in the network console.
* If there is an issue with the request  a *clear validation or error message* should be displayed to the user.

h4. *Actual Result:*

Cash Receipt Report Automatically Displays Data Upon Navigation Without Applying Any Filters

h4. *Description:*

h4. *Preconditions:*

* The user is logged into the ERP system.
* The *Cash Receipt Report* module is accessible.

h4. *Steps to Reproduce:*

# Navigate to *Finance Module > Reports > Cash Receipt Report*.
# Observe that the report *immediately loads and displays data* without requiring any filter selection.

h4. *Expected Result:*

Cash Receipt Report Uses a Single Date Input Field for ""From"" and ""To"" Dates  Causing Inconsistencies

h4. *Description:*

The *Cash Receipt Report* screen provides only *one date input field with a single calendar* to select both the *From Date* and *To Date*. This implementation causes inconsistencies in date selection logic and triggers *unwanted required validation errors*  even when a valid date is selected.

h4. *Preconditions:*

* The user is logged into the ERP system.
* The *Cash Receipt Report* screen is accessible.

h4. *Steps to Reproduce:*

# Navigate to *Finance Module > Reports > Cash Receipt Report*.

# Select a *From Date* and observe that the same input is used for the *To Date*.
# Attempt to generate the report.
# Notice that an *unnecessary required validation message appears*  even though a valid date has been selected.

h4. *Expected Result:*

* There should be *two separate date fields* for *From Date* and *To Date*.
* The system should correctly validate the date range without displaying *unnecessary required validation messages*.
* The report should be generated successfully when valid dates are selected.

h4. *Actual Result:*

* The system provides *only one date input field* for both *From* and *To* dates.
* The user encounters *inconsistent behavior* when selecting date ranges.
* A *required validation error* is displayed *incorrectly*.

h4. *Suggested Fix:*

* Implement *two separate date input fields* for selecting *From Date* and *To Date*.
* Ensure that the validation logic *properly checks the selected date range*.
* Remove unnecessary *required validation errors* that occur even when valid dates are selected.

Cash Payment Report Uses a Single Date Input for ""From"" and ""To"" Dates  Causing Inconsistencies and Validation Issues

h4. *Description:*

The *Cash Payment Report* screen allows users to filter reports using a *date range*; however  it only provides a *single date input field with one calendar* to select both the *""From"" and ""To"" dates*.

* The *Cash Payment Report* screen is accessible.

h4. *Steps to Reproduce:*

# Navigate to *Finance App > Reports > Cash Payment Report*.
# Locate the *date input field* for selecting the date range.
# Click the *calendar icon* and select a date.
# Observe that the same *single date input field is used* for both *""From"" and ""To""* dates.
# Try to generate the report  and observe the *validation messages*.

h4. *Expected Result:*

* The report should have *two separate date input fields*:
** *""From Date""*: Start of the date range.
** *""To Date""*: End of the date range.
* Users should be able to *select the date range correctly* without confusion.
* The system should *not display unnecessary validation errors*.

h4. *Actual Result:*

* A *single date input field* is used for both ""From"" and ""To"" dates.
* The system displays *inconsistent required validation messages*.
* Users *cannot properly define a date range*  leading to *incorrect report filtering*.

h4. *Suggested Fix:*

* Replace the *single date input field* with *two separate date pickers* for ""From"" and ""To"" dates.
* Ensure the validation logic correctly checks whether both dates are selected.
* Prevent *invalid date ranges* (e.g.  ""To Date"" should not be earlier than ""From Date"").

# The order of the action buttons (e.g.  View  Edit  Delete  Print) is not correct or consistent with the application's design standards.
# No tooltips are displayed when hovering over the action buttons  making it difficult for users to understand their functionality.

Bug,(SP24): Non-descriptive error message displayed in a pop-up when selecting a Bank account with an invalid payment method,Hager Mostafa,Mohamed Said,2,New,2025-02-27T17:59:00Z,2025-02-27T17:59:00Z,"h4. *Title:*

Non-descriptive error message displayed in a pop-up when selecting a Bank account with an invalid payment method.

----

h4. *Description:*

When a user selects a *Bank account* that has a payment method other than *Transfer* (e.g.  Visa or Span) in the *Fund Transfer Add* screen  a non-descriptive error message is displayed in a pop-up at the bottom layer. The message reads:
*""Error you can't select bank without payment method.""*

This message is not informative  does not guide the user to resolve the issue  and appears in an incorrect view (pop-up at the bottom layer). According to the business rules  only Bank accounts with the *Transfer* payment method should be selectable for Fund Transfers.

----

h4. *Precondition:*

# The user is logged in with the necessary permissions.
# The *Fund Transfer Add* screen is accessible.
# At least one Bank account exists in the system with a payment method other than *Transfer* (e.g.  Visa or Span).

#* In the *Payment Hub Details* field  select a Bank account that has a payment method other than *Transfer* (e.g.  Visa or Span).
# Observe the system behavior.

----

h4. *Expected Result:*

* The system should display a *clear and informative error message* in the correct view (e.g.  near the *Payment Hub Details* field or in a modal dialog).
* The error message should guide the user to select a Bank account with the *Transfer* payment method.
* Example of an informative message:
*""Invalid Payment Method: Please select a Bank account with the 'Transfer' payment method.""*

----

h4. *Actual Result:*

* A non-descriptive error message is displayed in a pop-up at the bottom layer:
*""Error you can't select bank without payment method.""*
* The message does not specify the issue or guide the user to resolve it.
* The pop-up appears in an incorrect view (bottom layer)  making it less noticeable.

----

h4. *Impact:*

* Users are confused by the non-descriptive error message and may not understand how to resolve the issue.
* The incorrect placement of the pop-up (bottom layer) makes it easy to miss  leading to frustration and delays in completing the transaction.
* This issue affects the user experience and may result in incorrect data entry or abandoned transactions.

----

h4. *Severity:*

*Medium* – This is a usability issue that impacts the user experience but does not prevent the core functionality from working.

h4. *Attachments:*

# Screenshot of the non-descriptive error message in the pop-up.
# Screenshot of the Fund Transfer Add screen with the selected Bank account.
# Logs or additional error details from the system.

----

h4. *Root Cause Analysis (If Available):*

The issue occurs because:

# The system allows the selection of Bank accounts with payment methods other than *Transfer*  even though the business rules specify that only *Transfer* is acceptable.
# The error message is hardcoded and does not provide sufficient context or guidance.
# The pop-up is displayed in an incorrect view (bottom layer)  making it less noticeable and user-friendly.

----

h4. *Suggested Fix:*

# *Validation Rule:*
#* Update the system to filter and display only Bank accounts with the *Transfer* payment method in the *Payment Hub Details* dropdown.
#* If a Bank account with an invalid payment method is selected  prevent the selection and display an informative error message in the correct view.
# *Error Message:*
#* Replace the non-descriptive message with a clear and informative one  such as:
#*""Invalid Payment Method: Please select a Bank account with the 'Transfer' payment method.""*
# *UI/UX Improvement:*
#* Display the error message near the *Payment Hub Details* field or in a modal dialog for better visibility.
#* Ensure the message is displayed in a user-friendly format (e.g.  red text with an icon)."

h4. *Description:*

On the *Payment Reconciliation* screen in the *Finance App*  after clicking the *Save* button  the reconciliation is successfully saved  and a *success popup* is displayed. However  the screen remains stuck  and all manipulated fields still retain the same data and state instead of refreshing or redirecting. This creates confusion for users as they are unsure whether the reconciliation has been processed correctly.

h4. *Preconditions:*

* The user is logged into the ERP system with access to the *Finance App*.
* The user has navigated to *Finance Module ? Transactions ? Payment Reconciliation*.
* A customer and a payment have been selected.

h4. *Actual Result:*

* The *Save* button successfully saves the reconciliation and displays a success popup.
* The screen remains unchanged with all manipulated fields retaining the same data.
* Users are unsure whether the reconciliation was actually processed.

h4. *Suggested Fix:*

* Implement a *screen refresh or redirection* after successful reconciliation.
* Automatically *reset all fields* and update the invoice list to reflect the reconciliation.
* Ensure that reconciled invoices are *removed from the pending list*.
* Provide a clear confirmation message indicating that the process is complete and that no further action is required.

Search Functionality Sends Excessive Requests Due to Lack of Debouncing

----

*Description:*
The search functionality does not efficiently handle user input  causing an excessive number of requests to be sent to the server. Each time the user types a character  a request is immediately triggered  even if the time between keystrokes is less than one second. This can lead to server overload  performance issues  and unnecessary network traffic. Implementing *debouncing* should optimize the search behavior.

----

*Precondition:*

* The ERP system is accessible  and the user has access to the search feature.

----

*Steps to Reproduce:*

# Log in to the ERP system.
# Navigate to a screen where the search functionality is available.
# Start typing a search term letter by letter.
# Observe that each keystroke triggers a request without waiting for a pause in typing.

----

*Expected Result:*

* The search functionality should implement *debouncing*  meaning it waits for a short delay (e.g.  500–800ms) after the user stops typing before sending a request.
* This reduces unnecessary server requests and improves performance.

----

*Actual Result:*

* A request is sent for every character typed  even if the delay between keystrokes is very short.
* This causes excessive API calls  leading to increased server load and potential performance degradation.

----

*Suggested Fix:*

* Implement *Debouncing* in the search functionality to delay API requests until the user has stopped typing for a defined period (e.g.  500–800ms)."
